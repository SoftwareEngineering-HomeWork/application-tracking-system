The process of applying for jobs and internships is not a cakewalk. Managing job applications is a time-consuming process. Due to the¬†referrals and deadlines, the entire procedure can be stressful. Our application allows you to track and manage your job application process, as well as regulate it, without the use of cumbersome Excel spreadsheets.

Our application keeps track of the jobs you've added to your wish list. It also keeps track of the companies you've already applied to and keeps a list of any rejections. Rather than having the user browse each company's site for potential prospects, our application allows the applicant to search for them directly using basic keywords. Any prospective work offers can then be added to the applicant's wishlist.

## ‚≠ê Highlights ‚≠ê

### 1. Launch the Recruiter Dashboard for Job Management

Develop a comprehensive recruiter dashboard where recruiters can log in, create job listings with detailed information (e.g., role, skills, salary range, and description), and track all jobs they‚Äôve posted. This milestone focuses on equipping recruiters with a centralized platform to simplify the job creation process and ensure better visibility and control over their postings.

### 2. Implement Candidate Application Portal

Introduce a user-friendly candidate application interface allowing job seekers to browse available jobs and submit applications seamlessly. This milestone ensures candidates have an accessible and engaging platform to connect with opportunities, fostering a streamlined recruitment pipeline that benefits both recruiters and applicants.

### 3. Expand Job Data Coverage via Multi-API Integration

Develop and deploy a scalable system to expand job data coverage by integrating multiple public APIs to provide a diverse and comprehensive job database. This includes standardising data structures, automating daily data collection, optimising performance, and implementing user-specific filters for relevance. The system will feature secure API authentication, real-time updates, and error-handling mechanisms to ensure reliability. By incorporating regional and niche job boards, the platform will cater to a broader audience while remaining competitive and up-to-date with market trends.

### 4. LinkedIn and GitHub Integration

Integrate LinkedIn and GitHub to enhance the platform's functionality by enabling recruiters to directly access and filter applicant profiles based on their skills, projects, and professional experience. For users, this integration simplifies linking their LinkedIn profiles and GitHub repositories to strengthen their applications by showcasing relevant qualifications, certifications, and project portfolios. This feature creates a seamless connection between job seekers and recruiters, improving the hiring process and enhancing the overall user 

## Summary
The project aims to build a robust recruitment platform through four strategic milestones. It begins with developing a **Recruiter Dashboard** for managing job postings, ensuring streamlined job creation and visibility. Next, it introduces a **Candidate Application Portal** to create a seamless interface for job seekers to browse and apply for jobs efficiently. The platform will then expand its **Job Data Coverage** by integrating multiple APIs to provide diverse and relevant opportunities while ensuring real-time updates and scalability. Finally, **LinkedIn and GitHub Integration** will enhance functionality by enabling direct access to applicant profiles and portfolios, fostering better matches between candidates and recruiters. This comprehensive approach ensures an engaging, efficient, and data-rich recruitment experience for all users.
